										<h1>Projects</h1>
									</header>
									<p>These projects are a combination of projects I've completed on my own free time. Along with those that have been assigned as in-class assignments (Classes: Intro to Programming, Data Structures, Computer Organization and Architecture, and Energy Analytics Freshman Research Initiative).</p>
									
									<h1><strong>Java</strong></h1>
									<h3>Song</h3>
									<p>Use structured code involving loops to reduce redundancies and match a set output song. Along with developed basic functions to streamline the output process of repeated portions (i.e. chorus).</p>

									<h3>Flesch Grader</h3>
									<p>Implemented String parsing methods to calculate the number of sentences, syllables and words in a given text. Then take given elements to give a calculated score on the Flesch Scale of 1 to 100.</p>
									
									<h3>Home Field Advantage</h3>
									<p>Implemented String parsing methods to extract data from a given set to evaluate sport team's performance. Performance was then calculated with attention given to discovering advantage of a said team on a home field. Along with keeping track of number of total games, home team wins, percentage of home team games, and home team margin.</p>

									<h3>Personality Test</h3>
									<p>Took in raw data of a personality test and evaluated the number of answers (either A or B) given, and returned a result. Able to parse through multiple lines of test results and consider incompleted data.</p>

									<h3>Decryption</h3>
									<p>Using maps with the frequency of characters (only ASCII codes 0-127) was able to decrypt substitution chipers that are given to the code. Including several layers of encryption that incorporated different keys.</p>

									<h3>Connect Four</h3>
									<p>Takes in user input to display pieces on the board and allows for the two users to play the game.</p>

									<h3>Algorithm Bootcamp</h3>
									<p>Six different algorithms that consist of implementing various methods to perfrom set tasks and run experiments on given data.</p>

									<h3>Recursive Algorithms</h3>
									<p>Using recursive functions to solve various problems.</p>

									<h3>Anagram Solver</h3>
									<p>Using recursive functions to solve anagrams inputted to the code.</p>

									<h3>Binary Search Trees</h3>
									<p>Implement a Binary Search Tree data strucute with the neccessary helper methods and try to follow the Java included structure as closely as possible.</p>

									<h3>Linked Lists</h3>
									<p>Implement a Linked List data strucute with the neccessary helper methods and try to follow the Java included structure as closely as possible.</p>

									<h1><strong>Python</strong></h1>
									<p>Class assignment done for a Freshman Research Initiative.</p>

									<h3>Windmill Predictions</h3>
									<p>Using machine learning models, identified patterns within wind power and windmills within each state. As to examine the pattern between the energy output, windmill placement and average windspeed within states.</p>
									
									<h1><strong>C++</strong></h1>
									<p>These are personal projects I've completed on my own time after learning some very basic C++ for a high school course.</p>

									<h3>Quadratic Calculator</h3>
									<p>Takes in a Quadratic function and can evaluate roots, x-intercepts, y-intercepts and can give a table of values based off a user inputted parameter.</p>

									<h3>Interest Calculator</h3>
									<p>A calculator program that shares the present (initial) value needed for an investment with a set interest rate and time to grow into a given amount.</p>

									<h3>Kinetic Energy Calculator</h3>
									<p>A program that calculates kinetic energy from user inputted values for mass and velocity.</p>

									<h3>Fahrenheit to Celsius Conversion</h3>
									<p>A program that converts a user inputted fahrenheit value and converts it to the appropriate celsius value and returns it.</p>

									<h1><strong>C</strong></h1>
									<p>Class assignments that used C along with incorporating ARM assembly and the Linux Terminal. </p>

									<h3>Linux Lab</h3>
									<p>An introductory assignment to lay the ground work for working with SSH, linux, arm assemebly and the terminal.</p>

									<h3>Command Interpreter</h3>
									<p>Create an interpreter for an EEL (Expression Evaluation Language), and incorporate all the neccessary elements for evalauting the language properly.</p>

									<h3>Memory Management</h3>
									<p>Created a storage allocation program for C. The program incorporated self-designed routines for Malloc and Free within the C library. While maintaining space-efficiency and high-throughput.</p>

									<h3>Assembly Coding</h3>
									<p>Created code to complete and run 8 different functions using a smaller subset of Arm assembly. Along with learning how to use a Virtual Machine to run and access code.</p>
